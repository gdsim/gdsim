# GDSim: a platform for benchmarking geo-distributed job schedulers

This program/library is meant to allow for easier first-level comparison of job schedulers for geo-distributed data centers.
It was created because we found no suitable simulators for comparing job schedulers for geo-distributed data centers.
This does not substitute building a test bed for that comparison, but that is a costly solution that can be used later.

Currently under development.
